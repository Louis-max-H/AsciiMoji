For the database, if you want to complete the database, send me your emojis and I would be happy to add them!

## Why ?
Not ? I was wondering if I could create one, so I did.
Moreover, the ascii emoji are supported by more interfaces than the current emoji, it's up to you to customize them!

By the way, don't hesitate to send me yours, I'll be happy to add them !
